Through a combination of side-scrolling action stages and overhead-view \"god\" simulation mode the Master slowly rebuilds his world and regains his followers and powers. He is not referred to as a deity of any kind, and it is stated in the manual that he is mortal, and this is the reason he hid away from the demons he was fighting when he had just enough power to seal himself away and wait them out.",
