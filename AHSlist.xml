<info>Two Swedish tourists check in to the Hotel Cortez in downtown Los Angeles. They are attacked by a disfigured creature who was inside their room's mattress. Iris (Kathy Bates), the manager of the hotel, moves them to Room 64. Meanwhile, Detective John Lowe (Wes Bentley) is investigating the torture-murder of a couple. During his investigation, John receives a strange phone call telling him to go to the hotel where he will find a clue. At the Cortez, John falls asleep and wakes up with a vision of his missing son Holden (Lennon Henry). Heroin addict Gabriel (Max Greenfield) checks in and is violently raped by the Addiction Demon; before Gabriel dies, Hypodermic Sally (Sarah Paulson) appears and asks him to tell her that he loves her. Elizabeth (Lady Gaga) and Donovan (Matt Bomer) have a foursome with a couple they met. During sex, they slit the couple's throats and savor their blood. Will Drake (Cheyenne Jackson), the new hotel owner, arrives with his son Lachlan (Lyric Lennon). In a flashback to 1994, Sally and Donovan check in to the Cortez. Iris knocks on their door and argues with Sally for drugging her son. When Sally leaves disoriented, Iris shoves her out a window to her death. John Lowe arrives at the hotel with his luggage, and checks in to Room 64.</info>
